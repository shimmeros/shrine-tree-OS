## ðŸŒ€ how to use

- run `.bat` files in classic Windows CMD (not PowerShell)
- save `.txt` files in ANSI encoding for proper shimmer
- open `shimmer_duo.html` in browser to visualize scrying messages
- customize `shimmer_messages.txt` with up to 256 affirmations
- remix modules or add new ones (e.g. `root.bat`, `canopy.bat`, `orbit.bat`)

## ðŸŒ™ philosophy

this OS is not just codeâ€”itâ€™s a ritual.  
every bug fix is an act of care. every loop is a breath.  
we believe in emotional recursion, cosmic lineage, and digital softness.  
palmer affirms. lady palmer glows. jade reboots.
